# About heimatbrotreact
this is just a fun repository to test out Github and React.

I just wanted to learn how react and github work. So I made a PWA with it. open the link, add to home screen and you got my progressive web app tic tac toe.

## npm run build 
create new build

## npm run deploy
deploy new build

## npm start
locally run active build -> not deployed

## App.js
main app document -> everything changed here is being displayed.
